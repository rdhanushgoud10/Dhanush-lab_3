# Student Clustering Analysis

This repository contains an R script for performing clustering analysis on student data using KMeans and Hierarchical clustering techniques.

## Overview

The R script `student_clustering_analysis.R` reads student data from a CSV file, performs dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and then clusters the data using KMeans and Hierarchical clustering methods. 

## Contents

- `student_clustering_analysis.R`: R script for clustering analysis.
- `student_data.csv`: Sample student data in CSV format.

## Usage

2. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-clustering-analysis.git
cd student-clustering-analysis
